# Computer Science

### Description
Having pursued Aerospace Engineering, I find my knowledge in Computer Science Domain lacking. 
I crafted a series of self-paced learning curriculum to enhance my knowledge in the Computer Science domain.
I intend to complete this self-paced curriculum hopefully by the end of 2024.
