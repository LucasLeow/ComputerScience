# Computer Science

### Description
Having pursued Aerospace Engineering for my undergraduate studies, I find my knowledge lacking in the Computer Science Domain.
Hence, I crafted a series of self-paced learning curriculum for myself to enhance my knowledge in Computer Science.
I intend to complete this self-paced curriculum as best as I can, hopefully by the end of 2024.
